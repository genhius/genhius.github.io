	<h1>ARTIST STATEMENT</h1>

	<p>I am a visual artist who uses art as a mean of self-expression. I have a great passion for photography, drawing and digital art. I am often inspired by the art of cinematography, books and the events happening around me. My works focus on exploring the beauty of how we, as human beings, interpret the world around us and how we could use various types of art to convey our emotions.<br><br>

	With the constant improvement of technology, the humankind has become more influenced by  the use of digital media. Despite being opened up to ways of connecting people, we end up losing ourselves to the virtual world. In short, the more we expose ourselves online, the more vulnerable and lonely we are. We’ve never before been more in need of seeking ways to express ourselves than now, that’s where art comes in. I’ve always been inspired by how human are able to convey motions through art beautifully, from happiness to sadness, and how we could make people feel the same way that we do. Therefore, I find art a way to emotionally connect to people and to deal with issues that evoke feelings. <br><br>

	My goal is to explore and practice different kinds of art to tell stories and to express my thoughts. I believe that my artwork is success once it makes people feel something by looking at it. </p>
